## Clustering Datasets

An R-repackaging of datasets useful for evaluating clustering methods.  The source for most is http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets 

I would love to include additional clustering datasets, if folks would like to provide them or make a PR.

```{r child = 'vignettes/clusteringdatasets.Rmd'}
```
